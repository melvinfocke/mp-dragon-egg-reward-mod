# Configuration

The default reward type after the Ender Dragon boss fight is *PLACE_DRAGON_EGG* but you can change it. Create a new file called *dragon-reward-type.json* in the root directory of your minecraft installation. Then paste the according reward type string in the *dragon-reward-type.json* file. Here is an overview of all reward types:

| Reward Type        | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "GIVE_DRAGON_EGG"  | The dragon egg is given in the player's inventory. |
| "PLACE_DRAGON_EGG" | The dragon egg is placed on top of the end portal. |
| "NOTHING"          | The player won't get a reward.                     |

> *Note: Don't forget the quotation marks in your dragon-reward-type.json file!*
